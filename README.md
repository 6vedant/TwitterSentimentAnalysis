Sentiment Analysis of Popular Personâ€™s Tweets (Data Mining using Python)
This project was done by me under the mentorship of My Guide Dr. Shefalika Ghosh Samaddar.

Using tweepy, pandas and textblob, I have calculated the probability of next tweet of Popular Person say (@narendramodi), to be positive, negative or neutral.
I have also plotted the graph of dates wrt to number of likes, and number of retweets as shown in screenshots.
Plotted the pie chart for the source of coming tweets.
Also, included the code for getting the media file together with tweet.
